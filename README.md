# üóùÔ∏è Data Structures Course Assignments

This repository contains solutions to assignments from the Data Structures course implemented in Python. The assignments are organized into four directories: `CA-1`, `CA-2`, `CA-3`, and `CA-4`, each containing Python source files (`Q1.py`, `Q2.py`, `Q3.py`, and `Q4.py`) that solve various algorithmic and data processing problems.

## üìå Project Overview

- **CA-1**:
  - `Q1.py`: Ranks people based on points, selecting a percentage for promotion and sorting the rest alphabetically.
  - `Q2.py`: Processes queries on a string of rock types, calculating cumulative differences based on digit frequencies.
  - `Q3.py`: Counts clothing items (pirahan, kapshen, shalvar, joorab) meeting specific price, color, and model criteria.
  - `Q4.py`: Finds the maximum contiguous segment of zeros in an array, including a window of size `k`.

- **CA-2**:
  - `Q1.py`: Implements a command-line emulator for stack, queue, and linked list operations using decorators for input parsing and error handling.
  - `Q2.py`: Finds the maximum element in every sliding window of size `k` in an array using a deque for efficient processing.
  - `Q3.py`: Calculates the maximum number of items that can be bought with a budget, considering bulk discounts.
  - `Q4.py`: Determines the length of the longest valid substring of balanced parentheses and brackets using a stack.

- **CA-3**:
  - `Q1.py`: Implements a command-line emulator for min heap, binary search tree (BST), and Huffman tree operations, supporting heap operations, BST insertion, and Huffman coding cost calculation.
  - `Q2.py`: Maintains a dynamic median of a stream of numbers using a max heap and min heap to balance the input values.
  - `Q3.py`: Computes the minimum excluded value (MEX) of a dynamic list after adding or removing elements.

- **CA-4**:
  - `Q2.py`: Checks if a graph remains connected after sequentially removing vertices, using depth-first search (DFS).
  - `Q3.py`: Determines if a graph can be oriented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) by removing at most one edge per node.
  - `Q4.py`: Calculates the total weighted sum of edge contributions in a tree, using DFS to compute subtree sizes and edge weights.

## üß∞ Tools Used

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for implementation
- Standard Python libraries (`collections`, `sys`, `functools`, `heapq`) for data structures and algorithms

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kasra-noorbakhsh/DS-Course.git
   cd DS-Course
   ```

2. **Run a Specific Program**:
   ```bash
   # Example for CA-4 Q2.py
   cd CA-4
   python3 Q2.py
   ```

4. **Input**:
   - Each program expects input from `stdin`.
   - Example input format for `Q2.py` in `CA-4`:
     
     ```
     4 3
     1 2
     2 3
     3 4
     2
     3
     1
     ```

5. **Output**:
   - Programs output results to `stdout`.
